# Task 5: Decision Trees & Random Forests
This notebook is part of my AI & ML Internship at Elevate Labs.

## Dataset
- Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv)

## Objectives
- Train and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier
- Prevent overfitting and evaluate metrics
- Train a Random Forest model and compare performance
